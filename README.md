CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your-clerk-secret-key"

# E2B Code Interpreter
E2B_API_KEY="your-e2b-api-key"

# Inngest
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY="your-inngest-event-key"
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY="your-inngest-signing-key"
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Describe Your App**: Enter a natural language prompt describing the web application you want to create
2. **AI Generation**: Vibe's AI analyzes your prompt and generates the complete application code
3. **Live Preview**: See your app running instantly in the integrated preview
4. **Share & Collaborate**: Get a shareable URL to show your creation to others
5. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts to modify and improve your generated apps

## 🎯 Example Prompts

- "Create a todo app with dark mode and local storage"
- "Build a weather dashboard with charts and animations"
- "Make a portfolio website with a contact form"
- "Generate a calculator with a modern glassmorphism design"
- "Create a music player interface with playlist support"
